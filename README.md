## Installation

1. Install homebridge using: `npm install -g homebridge`
2. Install this plugin using: `npm install -g homebridge-neato`
3. If you don't have a Neato account yet, create one [here](https://www.neatorobotics.com/create-account/).
4. Update your configuration file. See the sample below.

## Configuration

Add the following information to your config file. Change the values for email and password.

### Simple

```json
"platforms": [
	{
		"platform": "NeatoVacuumRobot",
		"email": "YourEmail",
		"password": "YourPassword",
		"language": "de"
	}
]
```

### Advanced

Below are explanations for advanced parameters to adjust the plugin to your needs. All parameters are *optional*.

**refresh**  
Timer for periodic refresh of robot state. The default is `auto`. The options are:  
`auto` Updates the robot state when a cleaning was started via homekit so that you can activate automations based on a successful cleaning.  
`120` Or any other time in seconds (minimum `60`) is required if you want to receive robot state updates after starting the cleaning from outside of homekit (e.g. neato app or schedule).  
`0` Disables background updates completely.

**hidden**  
List of plugin features that you don't want to use in homekit (e.g. `dock`, `dockstate`, `eco`, `nogolines`, `extracare`, `schedule`, `find`, `spot`).

```json
"platforms": [
	{
		"platform": "NeatoVacuumRobot",
		"email": "YourEmail",
		"password": "YourPassword",
		"language": "de",
		"refresh": "120",
		"hidden": ["dock", "dockstate", "eco", "nogolines", "extracare", "schedule", "find", "spot"]
	}
]
```

## Tested robots
